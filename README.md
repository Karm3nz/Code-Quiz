# Code Quiz

## Description 

Let it be preparation for an interview, to making sure that you have the basic fundamental knowledge down, a code quiz can offer support in all these areas! This quiz does exactly just that for Javascript fundamental questions on functions, array, and string methods.

Some of the features of this code quiz is that it displays a countdown timer at the start of quiz, tallys score of the use based on how many questions are correctly answered, as well as how fast the user answers the questions, and stores/clears highscore in local storage.

From this project I learned that there are vastly different ways of arriving to the same outcome. Some paths make it less likely to encounter errors, are easier to read, while others are albeit a bit harder to read, display the functions to be executed from a different perspective. Due to time constraint, I've learned to make a list of projects to revisit exploring other methods to arrive to the same outcome.

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.


## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
